Draw polygon on Google map and calculate area

This is a sample to show how to use Google Map API V3 using draw and geometry libraries.

Using draw library, various geometries like Circle, Polygon & Line can be overlaid on top of Google Map.

Various geometric operations can be done hooking up draw events.

Here following sample actions I have tried :
- Show radius when Circle is drawn
- Show area when polygon is drawn
- Show length wehn line is drawn
